## What is it?
Well it's a game where you play 3 in a row but its 5 in a row and on a non-standard size map, so it's playable on a 5x5 to inf x inf grid
## How do I play it?
So the game rules is that you place your marker (a blue square or a red circle) and try to get 5 in a row while blocking the other player
from getting 5 in a row
